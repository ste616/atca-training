# Tutorial 1
An introduction to the software, and understanding online calibration.

## Goals of the tutorial

In this tutorial, you will learn:

* how to use [`rpfitsfile_server`](../../src/apps/rpfitsfile_server/),
  [`nvis`](../../src/apps/nvis/) and [`nspd`](../../src/apps/nspd),
* how the three applications interact with each other,
* what a typical 4cm CABB online calibration looks like.

After completing this tutorial, you will be able to use the tools to learn more
in the other tutorials.

## Getting the tools

We begin by getting and compiling the software. Instructions for doing this
are on the [front page](../../README.md) of this repository, under the "Installation"
heading. After you have successfully compiled the software, you can continue
this tutorial.

## Starting the tools for this tutorial

Open up three terminals. In one of these terminals, navigate to the path
`atca-training/tutorials/1_introduction` and in the other two go to
`atca-training/build`.

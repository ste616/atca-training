# NSPD
A "clone" of ATCA's SPD, with extra features.

## Introduction

The `nspd` application, like the `spd` application it clones and is used
online at the ATCA, allows you to view the raw data coming from the
telescope. It does this by displaying spectra for different antennas and
baselines for each integration.

## Usage

This is a command-line tool with a PGPLOT display.

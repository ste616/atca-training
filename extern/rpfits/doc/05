Well, you can believe me that it is.  Whether it belongs in the rpfits
documentation or the multibeam documentation is debatable.

The format is:

c SPECIAL FORMAT - for Multibeam at Parkes
c
c       QUANTITY   1:   0		i.e. antenna number = 0
c       QUANTITY   2:   azimuth
c       QUANTITY   3:   elevation
c       QUANTITY   4:   parallactic angle
c       QUANTITY   5:   focus_y
c       QUANTITY   6:   focus_z
c       QUANTITY   7:   focus_r
c       QUANTITY   8:   temperature
c       QUANTITY   9:   pressure
c       QUANTITY  10:   humidity
c       QUANTITY  11:   wind speed
c       QUANTITY  12:   wind direction
c       QUANTITY  13-16:  time of measurement of cal signals in Jy (ascii)
c Added 17 March 1999
c       QUANTITY  17:   reference beam
c

There are also extra quantities written for each antenna:
c
c       QUANTITY  15:   Calibration signal size in Jy - pol A
c       QUANTITY  16:   Calibration signal size in Jy - pol B
c       QUANTITY  17:   Total power counts - cal off - pol A
c       QUANTITY  18:   Total power counts - cal on - pol B
c       QUANTITY  19:   Total power counts - cal off - pol A
c       QUANTITY  20:   Total power counts - cal on - pol B
c

OK I'll change "SCANTYPE" to "OBSTYPE " - mjk's suggestion.

>Could you put an expanded description of the two-letter codes

I considered that, but 50 characters is not quite enough to cover
the possible combinations.  I'll look into whether I can put some useful
information in the comment area.

Cheers, Warwick.

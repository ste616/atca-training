I wasn't aware that sc_cal was used in this way!  There's nothing about it in
the rpfits documentation.

Fine, except that SCANTYPE = "track" seems oxymoronic - "SCAN" is an
unfortunate choice of collective noun for integrations in single dish
observing.  Could you put an expanded description of the two-letter codes
in the comment section of the card for human readers.

Cheers, Mark

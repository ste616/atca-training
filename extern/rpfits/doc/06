Where does this antenna 0 record occur in the sc_cal(sc_q,sc_if,sc_ant) array?
The current multibeam reader assumes that sc_ant is set to the number of beams
plus 1, and that the beams (ants) are written out in order with antenna 0
last.  Is that right?

The RPFITS definition gives

   element 1:      antenna number (points to AN table)
   element 2:      IF number (points to IF table)
   element 3:      X-Y phase in radians
   element 4:      sqrt(Tsys) of X in K**0.5
   element 5:      sqrt(Tsys) of Y in K**0.5
   elements 6-8:   sampler statistics for X
   elements 9-11:  sampler statistics for Y
   element 12:     flag (0 is good, otherwise is bad)
   element 13:     X-Y amplitude

Is element 14 the "on-source" flag?

Cheers, Mark

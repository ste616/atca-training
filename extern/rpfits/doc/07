Mark,

Yes, that is correct.  It does not really need to assume anything about
sc_ant, or the order of writing.  One could look to see if there is a 
block of quantities within sc_cal with QUANTITY 1 set to 0.  If so, the
extra info. is there, if not - as would be the case at Narrabri and Mopra -
then it's not there.

>Is element 14 the "on-source" flag?

The RPFITS definition is not correct.  
The file /nfs/atapplic/rpfits/doc/rpfits.defn says it's at location 12.

The following is the way it really is:

c       Description of system calibration data
c
c
c NORMAL FORMAT - one set for each antenna
c
c       QUANTITY  1:    antenna number
c       QUANTITY  2:    if number - i.e freq 1 or 2
c       QUANTITY  3:    A/B phase - radians
c       QUANTITY  4:    SQRT( Tsys-A ) * SIGN( Tcal_enabled ) - K**0.5
c       QUANTITY  5:    SQRT( Tsys-B ) * SIGN( Tcal_enabled ) - K**0.5
c       QUANTITY  6-8:  sampler statistics for A
c       QUANTITY  9-11: sampler statistics for B
c       QUANTITY  12:   parallactic angle
c       QUANTITY  13:   flag
c       QUANTITY  14:   A/B amplitude
c
c       flag format
c
c               bit 0   -       set if off source
c               bit 1   -       set if loss of sync in A
c               bit 2   -       set if loss of sync in B
c  2/2/97 - add more quantities for Multibeam
c
c       QUANTITY  15:   Calibration signal size in Jy - pol A
c       QUANTITY  16:   Calibration signal size in Jy - pol B
c       QUANTITY  17:   Total power counts - cal off - pol A
c       QUANTITY  18:   Total power counts - cal on - pol B
c       QUANTITY  19:   Total power counts - cal off - pol A
c       QUANTITY  20:   Total power counts - cal on - pol B
c
c
c
c SPECIAL FORMAT - for Multibeam at Parkes
c
c       QUANTITY   1:   0
c       QUANTITY   2:   azimuth
c       QUANTITY   3:   elevation
c       QUANTITY   4:   parallactic angle
c       QUANTITY   5:   focus_y
c       QUANTITY   6:   focus_z
c       QUANTITY   7:   focus_r
c       QUANTITY   8:   temperature
c       QUANTITY   9:   pressure
c       QUANTITY  10:   humidity
c       QUANTITY  11:   wind speed
c       QUANTITY  12:   wind direction
c       QUANTITY  13-16:  time of measurement of cal signals in Jy (ascii)
c Added 17 March 1999
c       QUANTITY  17:   reference beam

Mark,

To accommodate the new "multiple pointings per scan" (MX) mode, I propose
adding the current reference beam to the so-called sys-cal 
( i.e. baseline = -1 ) record which is written to the rpfits file
at the start of each integration.  It will be quantity number 17 in the
sc_cal array where the antenna number = 0. i.e. in the same area as the 
azimuth, elevation and focus parameters appear, immediately following
the time of measurement of the cal signal.  Unfortunately, this
location in current rpfits files is not defined.  It should be ignored
if there is no SCANTYPE card in the header - see below. 

I also propose writing a new user defined card ( the first ) to the header 
which will contain the scan_type parameter.  The first 10 characters
of the card will be "SCANTYPE= ".  The value will appear in card(11:30)
as a list of space separated two letter codes.  

Currently valid codes are:

	FS	ATCA style frequency switching - within a scan
	MO	ATCA style mosaicing mode
	PU	Pulsar binning mode
	TC	ATCA tied array circular polarisation
	TL	ATCA tied array linear polarisation
	RF	Reference scan - for single dish spectral line work.
	SF	Slow frequency switching - per integration cycle
	FF 	Fast frequency switching - within an integration cycle
	MX	Multibeam MX mode - multiple pointings within a scan

Comments ?

Cheers, Warwick.

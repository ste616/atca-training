Mark,

>From the Feb 2004 ATNF Newsletter;

 Reducing ATCA millimetre observations
 ...
 New monitoring data: The RPFITS file produced by an observation now
 contains weather measurements, antenna-pointing centre (in addition to
 delay centre), and a measure of the tracking error. In blustery
 conditions or when there are antenna drive problems, the tracking error
 may be a significant fraction of the 3-mm beam size. In this case, an observer can
 flag data based on excessive tracking error.

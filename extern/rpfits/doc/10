Mark,

Yes, the official definition of sc_cal is not in accordance with
what is done in practice.

In fact, in writing the data, I equivalence sc_cal to an array 
sc_buf( sc_q*sc_ant).  Note that, always, only one IF at a time gets 
written out, so that sc_if is always 1.

Readers should also do this, thus allowing sc_q to be a variable
which depends on the application. 

When we started fiddling with the number of quantities written, i.e.
with the multibeam data, this treatment of the sc_cal data became
necessary.

As far as the readers are concerned, livedata does the right thing.
I believe ATLOD also handles it correctly, because, for example, we can 
read LBA data, which has yet another number of quantities.

Unfortunately, the official definition of rpfits has never been modified
to reflect this change, and so you have probably been led astray.

Cheers, Warwick.
